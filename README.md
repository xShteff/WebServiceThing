# Web Service Thing

## Why?
Honestly, I don't know. The repo consists of two parts:
* A Java REST web service, that can be ran by using either Maven or Gradle, that generates a simple List of elements (well, cars in my case)
* An ASP.NET Core application with a .NET service that fetches and displays the data.
Yes, I'm aware this is not the best practice when it comes to consuming the service but meh.
